### Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- HTML and CSS: Pre-written templates for the game interface.
- JavaScript Game Logic: Implemented in the src/modules/Game.class.js file.
- Main Script: Integrates the game logic with the UI, found in the main.js script.

### Game Features

1. Game Board: A 4x4 grid where each cell can contain numbers like 2, 4, 8, ... 2^n.
2. Tile Movement: Players can use arrow keys to move tiles in four directions.
3. Tile Merging: When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a tile with the doubled number.
4. Random Tile Generation: After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell.
5. Win Condition: The game displays a win message when a tile with 2048 appears.
6. Game Over Condition: The game displays a game-over message when no more moves are available.
7. Score Tracking: The score increases by the sum of all merged tiles during each move.
8. Start/Restart Button: A button that starts the game or restarts it after the first move.
9. Dynamic UI Updates: The game board updates in real-time based on the playerâ€™s actions.
